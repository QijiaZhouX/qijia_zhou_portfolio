# Part II 

## Wireframes and storyboards

For my final project, I've devised a narrative framework primarily tailored for artists concerned about the potential upheaval AI-generated art may bring to their profession and the broader industry.

To initiate the discourse, I prompt the audience to envision a world deeply intertwined with AI—particularly in the artistic process—and contemplate how this integration might reshape the art realm. It's crucial to understand that AI's omnipresence in our lives isn't just limited to the practical spheres but extends its influence over creative domains as well.

In the initial segment, I delve into the historical evolution of AI and its consequential impact on the arts. This exploration aims to underscore that while the discourse surrounding AI and art isn't novel, the stakes and implications have shifted dramatically. No longer a mere subject of academic debate, the real-world consequences demand attention not just from the artistic community but from the general public—many of whom interact with AI regularly.

The subsequent section emphasizes the public's perception of AI-generated art. Drawing upon statistical data, I juxtapose the general populace's often optimistic stance with the apprehensions held within the artist community. This comparison illuminates potential challenges artists may face in the AI-influenced future.

In the third segment, I argue that despite the varying perspectives on AI in art, a collective agreement exists: the intrinsic value and dedication inherent in human-made art should never be undermined. We must rally together to advocate for regulatory measures surrounding AI-generated art, ensuring the protection and appreciation of human artists' contributions.

I conclude by providing resources for artists to safeguard their creations from unsolicited use in AI-driven platforms, underscoring the importance of artists' rights in this rapidly evolving landscape.

## User research and interviews

### Target Audience 


\ I am interviewing the following target people for feedback:

1. Classmates with Interest in Website Design and Storytelling: I envision classmates who possess a keen interest in design, especially those with a design background, as an ideal audience. Their expertise would allow them to evaluate the professional facets of my work critically.


2. Art and Design Students/Professionals: These individuals form the primary audience for my website. Their insights will be invaluable in refining the site's content and design. I'm also eager to understand their perspectives on the subject matter and discern any additional information they feel should be incorporated.

3. General Public: While the website is primarily tailored for artists, I believe it holds significant relevance for the wider public. Gaining insights from this demographic will help me identify any gaps in the content and understand how the site resonates with a broader audience.

|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Is there anything confusing?                       | The last part of the next steps, where there are three sections together, I am wondering what that does                            |
| Would this be something you'd want to listen to?            | Yes, I think it is an interesting topic; I am not familiar with it, though                                                         |
| Do you feel there is an appropriate flow?                   | I don't see a specific 'flow'; I think there is good information, but I find it hard to get the connection between sections |
| Is there anything that needs to be improved?                    | I would like more content on the details and to explain the connections between sections                                           |
| Who do you think is the intended audience?                  | I don't see a specific audience group; I think everyone can benefit from this website                                            |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently?       | No, not really, maybe just more content, and I think there is some typo in the website, be sure to fix that                                                                                        |

| Questions                                                   | 2nd Person (Art student, 25 years old)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Is there anything that is confusing?                       | It's not confusing, but I think there may be too many graphs on the same view. Have you ever heard of information architecture? You can build a map of which part you think is more important and highlight those instead of throwing all the pieces together |
| Would this be something you'd want to listen to?            | Yes, I think it is an interesting topic, I think it is a little bit deep and hard to discuss; it is something that Ph.D. students usually discuss                                                                                                     |
| Do you feel there is an appropriate flow?                   | I think there are some building blocks in the website, but you should make sure there can be detailed connections, so there will be a clearer flow of your story                                                                                                 |
| Is there anything that needs to be improved?                    | There may be more insights on how artists can use AI to improve their work and how to use that as a tool.                                                                                                                                               |
| Who do you think is the intended audience?                  | Generally, anyone can be the audience, but I like the end where you provided tools for artists to protect themselves                                                                                                                                           |

| Is there any additional information you would like to know? | I would like to know some up-to-date regulations, events, or news related to AI and copyright. I heard there are a few lawsuits; that could be an interesting addon to the website you have for now.                                                  |
