# AI Artistry - Art or Not?

## Outline
The realm of art has always been a testament to human creativity, a field where emotions, expressions, and aesthetics intertwine. However,
the onset of AI-generated art poses a significant question: can a creation generated from algorithms stand shoulder to shoulder with the spontaneous outbursts of human artistry?
Beyond the philosophical musing, AI's advent into artistry has also shited market dynamics and influenced artist's creative processes. 
This project will explore AI's place in the artistic landscape and shed light on its broader impact on the art market and the artist community. 
Through data visualizations and narrative exploration, we aim to paint a picture of the AI art phenomenon.


## Project Structure
Introduction:     
In recent years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed many sectors, signaling a new epoch in technological evolution. 
From healthcare to finance, industries are adapting and evolving, embracing the unprecedented changes brought by AI. 
Yet, the world of artistry—a realm emblematic of human emotion, creativity, and expression—stands at a crossroads.
Many artists, traditionally the torchbearers of human ingenuity, find themselves pitted against AI-generated art. 
They voice concerns over the sanctity of their work, fearing the potential erosion of intellectual property rights at the hands of relentless algorithms. 
This project delves into the intersection of technology and creativity, seeking to understand the evolving dynamics between human artists and AI artistry.
This type of concern does not only emerge in the artists; according to the report by McKinsey, generative AI has increased the automation potential across all occupations.

Historical Perspective
The debate surrounding the value of AI-generated art remains ongoing and fervent. 
In 2018, a notable incident marked a milestone: an artwork produced by an algorithm intended to challenge perceptions of machine-generated art astonishingly fetched $432,500 at Christie's New York auction. 
This discourse took a fresh turn as AI art garnered heightened attention in 2022.

Impact on Artist   

Artists themselves exhibit diverse reactions to the concept of AI-generated art. For many, the sale of their artwork constitutes a substantial portion of their income. Consequently, there's a growing concern among them about the potential of AI replacing this traditional revenue stream.

Future of AI in Art

## Data Source:
This dataset has been curated from various online sources and consists of survey data from both artists and the general public regarding their perceptions of AI art. This will enable us to contrast public sentiment with that of the artists themselves. Additionally, the dataset contains market data related to AI art, which can provide insights into emerging trends and potential shifts in the art industry. By examining this information, we aim to highlight potential challenges, particularly concerning copyright laws and compensation issues, that may arise with the proliferation of AI-generated art.
