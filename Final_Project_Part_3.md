# Part III


## Changes I made for the 

For my final project, I've devised a narrative framework primarily tailored for artists concerned about the potential upheaval AI-generated art may bring to their profession and the broader industry.

To initiate the discourse, I prompt the audience to envision a world deeply intertwined with AI—particularly in the artistic process—and contemplate how this integration might reshape the art realm. It's crucial to understand that AI's omnipresence in our lives isn't just limited to the practical spheres but extends its influence over creative domains as well.

In the initial segment, I delve into the historical evolution of AI and its consequential impact on the arts. This exploration aims to underscore that while the discourse surrounding AI and art isn't novel, the stakes and implications have shifted dramatically. No longer a mere subject of academic debate, the real-world consequences demand attention not just from the artistic community but from the general public—many of whom interact with AI regularly.

The subsequent section emphasizes the public's perception of AI-generated art. Drawing upon statistical data, I juxtapose the general populace's often optimistic stance with the apprehensions held within the artist community. This comparison illuminates potential challenges artists may face in the AI-influenced future.

In the third segment, I argue that despite the varying perspectives on AI in art, a collective agreement exists: human-made art's intrinsic value and dedication should never be undermined. We must rally together to advocate for regulatory measures surrounding AI-generated art, ensuring the protection and appreciation of human artists' contributions.

I conclude by providing resources for artists to safeguard their creations from unsolicited use in AI-driven platforms, underscoring the importance of artists' rights in this rapidly evolving landscape.
