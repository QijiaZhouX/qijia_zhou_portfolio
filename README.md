# About me
Hello! My name is Qijia Zhou, and I am passionate about data science and visualization. I want to leverage my technical skills to drive real-world innovations someday! This is my last year at CMU, and I am in the ETIM program(Engineering Technology Innovation Management), where my focus is Data Analytics and Data Science. I also have a dual degree in Biomedical Engineering at CMU, and I just finished that degree.   
During my time at CMU, I focused on data science and data analytics and have done some machine learning and statistical testing projects. This is my first time looking into the design aspect of data visualization, and I find the process fun and rewarding! 

# What I hope to learn
1. Data visualization skills, with Tableau especially
2. Storytelling skills, how to speak with the audience and make effective data visualization
3. Explore more design-oriented perspectives in data visualization, and do arts

## What I have learned   
In this course, I've had the exhilarating opportunity to delve into various data visualization tools, including Tableau and Flourish. The journey of exploring, experimenting, and troubleshooting these platforms has not only been challenging but profoundly rewarding. What I've come to appreciate most is the intricate art of design within data visualization. It's more than just presenting data; it's about crafting a visual narrative that resonates.  

Mastering the technique of audience-centric design has been a revelation. I've learned the subtleties of capturing attention and directing it to the crux of my message, making the information not just consumable but also engaging. This experience has elevated my storytelling prowess, infusing it with purpose and clarity.  

Reflecting on my past projects, I realize they were rich in data but lacked compelling narratives. Armed with these newfound skills, I am inspired to reframe my approach in future endeavors. It's no longer about just numbers or facts; it's about weaving a story that speaks, persuades, and, most importantly, endures. Data is the protagonist, and I am the storyteller, ready to bring its tale to life in a way that is as insightful as it is captivating.
