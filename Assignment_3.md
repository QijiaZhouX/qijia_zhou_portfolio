## Step one: find a data visualization:

<a href="https://projects.flowingdata.com/life-expectancy/" target="_blank">Life Expectancy Data Visualization</a>  

This is an interactive visualization, as we can see through the link above. It measures the life expectancy of different countries over the years, each line there indicates a country and audience can extract the datapoint from the visualization by clicking each line. 


## Step 2: Critique

Overall, this visualization looks overwhelming to me. There are so many data points, and it is hard to get the information for specific countries or regions in the world. I like the interaction of the graph and the way that the audience can go through all the countries and see the trends. I like the way that the author wrote there are several data points that we should draw more attention to and connect the history with the life expectancy value. The graph is intuitive, and it is easy for the audience to see the world's life expectancy trends. I also like the way we can select the region from the graph and only highlight that data. The problem is that we can not identify the data and get an immediate takeaway. Even though the author chose to include all the data points for every country, it is difficult to compare those data with each other. To improve, I came up with several solutions. 1. Using the word map and color to show the difference in life expectancy across countries. 2. Plot Lines for specific countries of interest to show the trends. 3. Add additional information like GDP values, and do a dot plot to show the change in life expectancy over the years and compare the difference with countries with different GDPs.   
The primary audience can be anyone who is curious of global life expectancy and wants to study how certain events or factors like GDP influence life expectancy and how the value changes over time and across different regions. I think the visualization is not so effective in reaching the audience because even though there are so many things to take away, it is hard to draw an effective conclusion besides the overall life expectancy increasing over time. However, if the audience is patient enough and has prior knowledge or is willing to gather more information, it is still possible for the audience to get a good takeaway.   
I think this type of visualization is not that successful. I think the comparison between countries and regions is missing, even though that is something the author intends to do. It is hard to compare all of those data points. I think instead of using a line chart, a dot chart or a map can be a better approach. I also think it is better to add more data points in the graph to give additional insights to the audience.
